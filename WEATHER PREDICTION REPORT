A data is a bunch of data.that corresponds one or more tables. where every column of a table represents a particular table.
In this module we get a prediction about weather seattle.
we analyse the weather seatle data set and predict about the precipitation and minimum temperature.
In this module we predict the weather whenever the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls pull gravitational from clouds.
minimum temperature difference is a measure of assesing the perfomance modulation of lower temperature like snow,rain,fog.
We describe the precipitation include drizzle,rain,snow,sun and fog.
In this data set we get a dependent dataset values as Minimum temperature,and independent dataset values as precipitation.
we are using jupyter tool for making this miniproject this tool is very user friendly and intuitive implement in python to communicate with the user.
To perform analysis for a particular resource and we display some graphs. to differ the dependent and independent values of analysis.
a dependent variable is the variable that changes as a result of the independent variable manipulation.
this outcome and measuring and it depends on our independent values.
An independent variable is exactly a variable that stand alone is not changed by other variable you are trying to measure.
linear regression analysis is usedto predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
finally we will describe all our reports and charts and the codes
thanking you!
